# INTRODUCTION
To investigate and evaluate FGF21 as a Biomarker in Intervention condition. An advanced learning appraoch have been applied known as Machine learning (ML). ML are able to improve prediction accuracy by discovering relevant features of high complexity 32. In this study, we foresee the weighted features by using three different feature selection (FS) algorithms which eliminate irrelevant or redundant features from the original data set. Accordingly, informative features remain which in turn might indicate their biological importance. However, regarding smaller data sets with mouse studies, the repetition of experiments is low and group size is limited. Therefore, applied models are often prone to biasing issues due to the small sample size. To target the problem at hand, we applied multiple classification models to ensure validation by quantity. The novelty of this study is to use the combination of ML method with FS which is considered as an additional tool, and statistical methods on a small data set of behavioural-physiological parameters for determining whether FGF21 can endure as a biomarker after tackling obesity in mice.
