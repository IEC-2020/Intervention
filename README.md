# Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 as a potential biomarker for mice behaviour after tackling obesity
@ Created by Dr. Alisha Parveen

# Abstract
Obesity is accompanied by behavioural disorders. Exercise, dietary adjustments, or time-restricted feeding are to date the only successful long-term interventions. By restoring the balance between disturbed energy dissipation and energy intake, Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) is intricately connected to nutritional regulation. The purpose of the study was to assess through behavioural parameters, whether FGF21 can endure as a biomarker after tackling obesity. Therefore, after establishing a diet-induced obesity model, mice underwent an intervention strategy with either a dietary change, treadmill exercise, or time-restricted feeding. In this study, we showed that the combination of dietary change with treadmill exercise resulted in body weight reduction, improved behavioural parameters, and the lowest FGF21 concentrations. Furthermore, feature selection algorithms revealed five highly weighted features including FGF21 and body weight. In conclusion, we suggest from the different analysis procedures that FGF21 can be considered as a potential biomarker since it endures after the intervention.

# Main task
We aimed to investigate whether FGF21 can endure as a predicted biomarker in mice after counteracting obesity. This code provides an insight overview of the machine learning section.
